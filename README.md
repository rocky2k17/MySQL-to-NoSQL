# SQL_to_NoSQL
A simple tool to migrate from an SQL database to a NoSQL database. Currently only supports convertion to MongoDB from any microoft SQL database. Will work on other databaes soon. Work still in progress. Feel free to explore around, ask doubts, clear some of *my doubts*, report issues etc.

## Getting Started
Tot try out this software for yourself, here's what you got to do
### Prerequisites
This tool migrates from one database to another(MongoDB, for now), so here are the basic requirements
- SQL database as an input to the tool. Here is a link to [SQL Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express)
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, for better visualisation and some initial configuration. Can go to this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) for docs and to download it.
- NoSQL database, MongoDB for now. Get that too thorough this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  - And don't forget to download MongoDB Compass, it helps to better visualise the mongo database
- Now follow the configuration steps for MS SSMS (SQL Server Management System) from this link (I'll have to look for it, give me a couple of days)
- Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, cause, this is a node app.

And yup, you are all set up

### Installing
- Next clone this software, or download the zip file and unzip it
- Run the following commands and get started
```
npm install
node app.js
```

## Built With
